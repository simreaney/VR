# 360 VR Photography Tours
This is a collection of 360 photography from a range of sites that I have worked at or have helped with the processing the images. The images are viewable on the desktop in a web browser or in a VR headset with the WebXR library. In a VR headset, in each of the tours you can click on the Durham University logo to enter the full VR mode. These tours were made with Pano2VR and a range of different cameras and drones. The drone stitching was done with PTgui.
